# advent-of-code-2024

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024!](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

## Why?

I want to keep my general programming skills sharp, and I found Advent of Code to be a great opportunity to escape tutorial hell. Any software engineer worth their paystub is a programming polyglot, so this repository will contain my answers in the programming languages that I'm currently interested in.

My learning method is pretty simple, solve the problem in pseudocode and then write a working script. Best practices will be loosely followed as my goal is to improve my problem-solving and coding skills while exploring new and familiar languages.

## How to run scripts

Each script will have a header object that contains a placeholder for your cookie session.

To find your cookie sessions you'll have to:

1. Authenticate to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com)
2. Open your browser's developer tools
3. Open the Application Tab
4. Open the Cookies section
5. Copy paste the `session` value
